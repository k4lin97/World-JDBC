## Introduction

An application that allows the user to connect to a database and display the information it contains.
The sample [world](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/world-setup/en/) database was used to create this project. User can display
the information contained in the database about countries, cities and languages.
One form of selecting results has been defined for each of them,
e.g. you can search for countries belonging only to a given continent.

## Technologies

Technologies used:
* Java 11
* Maven
* Swing API

one way of setting it up is to use xampp. The script for creating
database can be found in the resources folder.
